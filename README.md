# Python Variable Annotations Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing type annotations in Python, specifically for variables and functions. Each task involves writing type-annotated functions or defining annotated variables.

## Project Structure

- `0x00-python_variable_annotations/`: Directory containing Python scripts for each task.
- `0x00-python_variable_annotations/0-add.py`: Task 0 script.
- `0x00-python_variable_annotations/1-concat.py`: Task 1 script.
- ... (continue for each task)
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Tasks

### Task 0: Basic annotations - add
Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes two float arguments and returns their sum as a float.

### Task 1: Basic annotations - concat
Write a type-annotated function `concat` that takes two string arguments and returns their concatenation.

### Task 2: Basic annotations - floor
Write a type-annotated function `floor` that takes a float argument and returns its floor as an integer.

### Task 3: Basic annotations - to string
Write a type-annotated function `to_str` that takes a float argument and returns its string representation.

... (continue for each task)

## Usage
To run each task script, use the provided `main.py` files as demonstrated in the task descriptions.

Example:
```
$ ./0-main.py
```
